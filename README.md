# PROJECT TOPIC: E-COMMERCE SALES ANALYSIS

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
This Data Analysis project aims to generate insights into the sales performance of the e-commerce project over the past year. 
By analysing the various parameters in the data received we seek to gather enough insight to make reasonable decisions which 
then enables us to tell compelling stories about our data from the insight gotten and to know the best performance of our data.  

# DATA SOURCE
The primary source of this data used here is data sales.csv and this is an open source that can be freely downloaded 
from an open source online such as kaggle or FRED or any other repository site.

### TOOLS USED

### DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION
In the initial phase of data cleaning and preparation, we perform the following actions;
    
    a. Data loading and inspection
    b. Handling missing variables
    c. Data cleaning and formatting
    
## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
EDA involves the exploring of the data to answer some questions about the data such as:
    -What product is the overall sale trend
    -Which product are top sellers
    -what are the products on peak sales

## DATA ANALYSIS
This is where we include some basic lines of codes or queries or even some of the DAX 
expressions used during the analysis.

        SELECT A,B,C

        WHERE A > 15
